# Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project
This project was completed by Demetrius Beckham in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Spring 2018. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. 

In particular, I have:
Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. 
The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or para- phrasing thereof– has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.

And I understand that:
Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.

I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.

Happiness is a subjective concept that people readily assume can be measured. The 6th World Happiness Report was published in 2018, to survey the science of measuring and understanding subjective well-being.

In this project we set out to further analyze the results observed in this published report. Why do certain factors impact happiness over others? Does wealth lead to health and happiness? Are there any patterns worth identifying when it comes to how people in different countries view happiness? What are some ways in which the overall global level of happiness could be improved over time?
