# Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project
This project was completed by Demetrius Beckham in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Spring 2018. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. 

In particular, I have:
Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. 
The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or para- phrasing thereof– has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.

And I understand that:
Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.

I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.

This project will study how the racial make-up of a school can come to affect the quality of education students recieve. Three factors that will be observed to gauge quality are disciplinary actions, Advanced Placement test taking and the finances given to schools. The data spans from 2000 to 2015. This project will describe and visualize the variables that encourage a difference in education quality.
