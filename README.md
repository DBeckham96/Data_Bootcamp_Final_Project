# Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project
This project was completed by Demetrius Beckham in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Spring 2018. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. 

In particular, I have:
Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. 
The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or para- phrasing thereof– has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.

And I understand that:
Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.

I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.

The central questions we sought to explore with this project were as follows:  Can a program accurately analyze the sentiment of textual news? Can we build a profitable trading strategy on sentiment analysis? Using market moving news gathered from hundreds of companies on the S&P 500, our analysis tool aims to evaluate the performance of sentiment analysis by comparing it to the returns company’s observed during specific periods of time, over more than a decade. This project was inspired by Kylie Jenner’s Twitter rant that negatively impacted Snap Inc. and its stock price. However, we made the conscious decision to avoid social media news because it is difficult to gauge what is new and relevant to the information we seek. Instead, this project focuses on corporate releases which are usually “new,” and material information released on the particular dates we are observing. In the end, the success of this sentiment analyzer will result in continued efforts to analyze the sentiments of other news in other sectors of finance, entertainment and society.
